# Mono Manager

A simple project and task management app built with Next.js. This is a hobby project I made for my own use to keep track of projects and tasks.

## What it does

- Create and manage projects
- Add tasks to projects with different statuses
- Basic project and task organization
- That's it. Nothing fancy.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you're good to go.

## About this project

This is a personal hobby project. I built it because I needed something simple to manage my projects and tasks. It does what I need it to do.

If it works for you too, great. Feel free to use it, fork it, or do whatever you want with it.
